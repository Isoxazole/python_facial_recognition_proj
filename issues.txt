This is a simple little text document to talk through some of our code.

Regarding the walkDirs.py, it currently copies the images to a directory. I do not believe this is needed as we can make a simple little file to put the location of each image in, and then feed that to our code to do facial recogniztion.

Need to decide how to make this somewhat user friendly. Command line interface?
