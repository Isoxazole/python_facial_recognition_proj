# PythonFinalProj
A collection of files for Python final project

Project is meant to be able to walk through the contents of an entire hard drive and make collections of viable images. After a collection of these images is cached, the images will be run through OpenCV to search for a desired face, a predetermined image to match.

This is meant to help photographers with large libraries of images to search for specified faces, using OpenCV as a backend.

Frameworks required:
	Numpy
	OpenCV
